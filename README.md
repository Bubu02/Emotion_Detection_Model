# Emotion Detection from Facial Expressions

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion detection from facial expressions. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which is a widely used dataset for facial expression recognition tasks.

## Features

- The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers, all implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
- The project includes a GUI for real-time emotion detection from webcam feed.
- The model is trained to recognize seven different emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

## Requirements

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory `cd emotion-detection`
3. Install the necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the `gui.py` script to start the GUI for real-time emotion detection: `python gui.py`
